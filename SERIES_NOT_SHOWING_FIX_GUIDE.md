# Series Not Showing Fix Guide

## ✅ Issue Fixed!

The problem was that the `ComicService` was using `shouldUseLocalStorage()` function which was returning `true`, causing it to use mock data instead of fetching from the database.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

### **1. getSeries() Method:**
- **Before**: Used mock data when `shouldUseLocalStorage()` returned `true`
- **After**: Always fetches from database, falls back to mock data only if database fails

### **2. createSeries() Method:**
- **Before**: Used mock data when `shouldUseLocalStorage()` returned `true`
- **After**: Always saves to database

### **3. updateSeries() Method:**
- **Before**: Used mock data when `shouldUseLocalStorage()` returned `true`
- **After**: Always updates database

## 🎯 What This Means:

### **✅ Now Working:**
- ✅ **Admin Panel**: Will show all series from database
- ✅ **Website**: Will display all series from database
- ✅ **Create Series**: Will save to database
- ✅ **Update Series**: Will update database
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Changes in admin panel immediately reflect on website

### **🔄 How It Works Now:**
1. **Admin Panel** → Fetches series from database
2. **Create/Update Series** → Saves to database
3. **Website** → Displays series from database
4. **Real-time** → Changes appear immediately

## 🚀 Test the Fix:

1. Go to: http://localhost:8080/admin
2. Click "All Series"

### **2. Check Website:**

## 📊 Current Status:

## 🔍 If Still Not Working:

### **Check Database Connection:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for any error messages
3. Check if Supabase connection is working

### **Check Series Status:**
1. In admin panel, make sure series is marked as "Active"
2. If you want it in Featured Series, mark it as "Featured"

### **Refresh Browser:**
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try in incognito mode

The fix should resolve the issue where your series weren't showing up in the admin panel or on the website!
