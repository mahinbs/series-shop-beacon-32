# SIMPLE FIX FOR PROFILE PICTURES - NO SQL NEEDED!

## The Problem
The `storage.objects` table requires superuser privileges that you don't have in the SQL Editor.

## EASY SOLUTION - Use Supabase Dashboard

### Step 1: Go to Storage in Supabase Dashboard
1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **Storage** (left sidebar)
3. Look for the **`profile-pics`** bucket

### Step 2: Create the Bucket (if it doesn't exist)
If you don't see `profile-pics` bucket:
1. Click **"New bucket"**
2. Name: `profile-pics`
3. **Check "Public bucket"** ✅ (THIS IS CRUCIAL!)
4. Click **Create bucket**

### Step 3: Make Existing Bucket Public (if it exists)
If the bucket exists but is private:
1. Click on the **`profile-pics`** bucket
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
3. **Toggle "Public bucket" to ON** ✅
4. Click **Save**

## Alternative: Use a Different Approach

Instead of fighting with storage policies, let's use the **`images`** bucket which already works:
