# Series Management Guide

## ✅ Problem Fixed!

The Featured Series and All Series sections were using hardcoded dummy data. I've now connected them to the database so you can manage them through the admin panel.

## 🎯 How to Manage Series

### **Admin Panel Navigation:**
1. Go to **http://localhost:8080/admin**
2. Login with: `admin@series-shop.com` / `Admin@2024!`

### **Two Main Sections:**

#### **1. Featured Series Management**
- **Location**: Admin Panel → **"Featured Series"** (formerly "Our Series")
- **Purpose**: Manage series that appear in the "Featured Series" section on the homepage
- **How it works**: 
  - Add new series
  - Toggle **"Featured"** switch to make them appear in Featured Series section
  - Set display order to control the order they appear

#### **2. All Series Management** 
- **Location**: Admin Panel → **"All Series"** (formerly "Comic Series")
- **Purpose**: Manage all series that appear in the "All Series" section
- **How it works**:
  - Add new series
  - Toggle **"Active"** switch to make them visible on the website
  - Set display order to control the order they appear

## 🔧 How to Add New Series

1. Navigate to **http://localhost:8080/admin**
2. Click on **"All Series"** in the sidebar

### **What You Need to Do:**

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If you see "No featured series available":**
- Make sure you have series marked as "Featured" in the admin panel
- Make sure the series are marked as "Active"

### **If you see "No series available":**
- Make sure you have series marked as "Active" in the admin panel
- Check that the series have proper data filled in

### **If admin panel shows "Data not found":**
